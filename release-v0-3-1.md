# Patch 0.3.1 Changelog

### Balance Fixes
- The boss of [The Tenth Witch] was made actually challenging.
- The loot of the [Tower of Jainkonius] was OP, and so was nerfed.
- The sewers mini-dungeon was possible to complete without first getting a Breathing Helmet, so the number of air pockets was drastically reduced.

### Additions
- A mini-dungeon, the Diorite Cave, has been added to hold the Breathing Helmet.
- /quests now actually has functionality to show your quest progress!!!
- Advanced storage system through Shulker Boxes in the Astonia City Bank.
